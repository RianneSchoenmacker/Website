Everyone faces difficult moments in life—what I call “black shadows.” To remove shadows, you need to add light. I’ve visualized this by allowing you to physically clear that shadow from your mind by crumpling a sheet of paper into a ball. Each shadow in your life is unique, just like every paper ball you create.

You light the ball on fire. As it burns, it slowly turns black and gray, symbolizing your shadow. When the ball is fully consumed, it crumbles and disappears. At that moment, you’ve taken a break from your shadow, and it’s time for you to add light. The colors from the paper are now yours to use as a reminder of that transformation.

Text on the side:

When you’re confronted with a difficult shadow in life, you need to add light to make it fade. Visualize this by crumpling a sheet of colored paper into a ball. Each shadow is unique, and so is each ball you make. Light it on fire, and as it burns, the ball turns black and gray, representing your dark spot. When the ball has completely burned and crumbles to ash, you’ve taken a break from your shadow. Now it’s your turn to add light and use the colors from the paper to brighten your path forward.

Text on the bottom:

Red, yellow, and orange are the colors of the flame that slowly burns away your shadow. The warmth brings comfort and safety, helping you take the next step in your journey and continue where you left off. The colors from the paper are now yours, replacing the blackness with light. Take a deep breath in, then exhale. As you breathe out, the last remnants of darkness blow away, leaving you ready to move forward.
