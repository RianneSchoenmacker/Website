<h1>Digital Innovation: Bedraden Draden 2.0</h1>

In the next phase of my project, "Bedraden Draden 2.0," I focused on creating a precise 1:1 replica of the original rug, maintaining all its functions in the digital version. While the physical rug provides a tactile experience, digitizing it opened up new possibilities for interaction and design.

Using Blender, I meticulously simulated the rug, replicating every detail—from the texture of the yarn to the light patterns that react to touch. This allowed me to recreate the same magical interaction present in the physical rug within a digital environment.

I also utilized Spline to further expand the rug's interactive features, such as the responsiveness of light and motion. In this digital space, users can manipulate the effects in real-time, mirroring the way the rug reacts to touch in the real world. The digital replica retains all the characteristics of the original design while offering new opportunities for experimentation and interaction.

Through this process, I’ve created a digital version of the rug that mirrors the physical one, achieving a seamless transition between the two realms. However, this journey has also taught me that while the digital environment offers new possibilities, the presence of a screen inevitably creates a greater distance between the user and the work.
